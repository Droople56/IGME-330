# Bananagans 2: Simian Standoff

Stationary Wave Based Defense

## Story
Monk Ley successfully repelled the Lumberjacks from destroying your home, but it is now up to you to hold the line while your comrades rebuild. You must hold a barricade at the outskirts of your territory, slowly building up more defenses and upgrading them to make your job a little easier. Don't, however, discard the threat that the Lumberjacks pose, as they will crash against your defenses in waves, progressively getting more challenging with each success.
